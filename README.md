### 👋 I am an IT Strategist for Higher Education

With **12+ years in the education sector**, I bridge the gap between complex technology and academic needs. I don’t play politics; I rely on **process, standards (ISO 27001/ITIL), and data** to build systems that are fair and transparent.

* 🧭 **My Philosophy:** IT is not about control; it is about **service**.
* 🎯 **My Goal:** To build a **"Digital Campus"** where technology is **invisible, secure, and helpful**.

### 🧭 What I Believe

I am a **quiet builder**. I don’t chase noise or titles; I build systems that work and cultures that last. To me, IT isn't about cables and servers—it is about **trust, continuity, and responsibility.**

* 🏛️ **Structure creates Calm:** I believe in **SOPs over shouting**. Clear processes remove the need for heroism or drama.
* 🤝 **People First:** Technology should **prevent burnout**, not cause it. I build systems that respect human limits.
* 🛡️ **Integrity is Binary:** I am allergic to politics. I believe in **accountability without blame** and results without ego.
* 🌱 **Legacy:** My goal isn't just to fix today's problem, but to build knowledge and systems that **outlive me**.
