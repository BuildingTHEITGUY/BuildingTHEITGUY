### 🧭 What I Believe

I work in **higher-education IT**, where systems don’t just need to run—they need to **support learning, trust, and compliance.**

* 🚀 Technology should **reduce stress**, not create it.
* 🛡️ Strong IT comes from **process, ethics, and calm execution**.
* 👁️ **The Turing Standard:** I build centralized, transparent systems that make manipulation impossible.
* 🤝 Leadership is about **removing chaos**, not adding control.
